This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in VHDL code: counter overflow. The `bug.vhdl` file contains a simple counter that is prone to overflow.  The `bugSolution.vhdl` provides a corrected version that handles the overflow condition gracefully.  This example highlights the importance of careful consideration of data types and potential overflow scenarios when designing digital systems using hardware description languages like VHDL.
